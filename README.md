# Sorting-Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in Python using Pygame.

## Implemented Basic Sorting Algorithms: Ascending and Descending Order

1. Bubble Sort: Compares two adjacent elements (forming a pair/bubble of two elements at a time) and swap them until they are in the intended order.
2. Insertion Sort: Places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration. Works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.
3. Selection Sort: Select the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and place that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.
